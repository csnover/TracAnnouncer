    In addition to other methods that may notify you of changes to Wiki pages, you may list here
    pages that are of interest to you. Each page should be on a separate line.

  <p i18n:msg="">
    You may use wild cards, so that if you want to hear about any page that starts with the name 'Trac'
    you would enter on it's own line: <strong>Trac*</strong>

  <p i18n:msg="">
    To receive a notice about all wiki changes, simply include a <strong>*</strong> by itself.
