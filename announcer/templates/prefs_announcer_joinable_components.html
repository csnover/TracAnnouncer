 Components are a way to classify trac tickets.  The following components have been defined by the Trac administrators.  If you subscribe to any of these components, you will receive an notification anytime a ticket related to that component is changed or created.  <ul py:for="name, val in components.items()">
    <li>
      <input type="checkbox" name="component_${name}" checked="${val}" value="1" /> ${name}
    </li>
  </ul>
